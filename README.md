# Pentesting-Windows-Linux
I used all of the penetration tools, strategies, and exploits I've learned to exploit the technical infrastructure of a fictional company, Rekall Corporation.
The goal was to look for "flags" within the organization's web application and operating systems.
This test took place over the course of 4 days, and each day required engaging in all 5 phases of pentesting:

1a.) Planning 1b.) Reconnaissance 2.) Scanning 3.) Exploitation 4.) Post Exploitation 5.) Reporting


Day 1 - Exploited the web application

Day 2 - Exploited the Linux Servers

Day 3 - Exploited the Windows Servers

Day 4 - Compiled a detailed report of my findings
